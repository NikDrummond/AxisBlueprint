# AxisBlueprint

**AxisBlueprint** is a lightweight Python toolbox for interactively designing scientific figure layouts. With its easy-to-use Tkinter GUI, you can create, move, and resize axis boxes on an A4 template (with a half-centimeter grid) and then generate Matplotlib code to recreate your layout.

## Features

- **Interactive Layout Design:**  
  Create, duplicate, and remove axis boxes on a grid overlayed A4 template.
  
- **Move and Resize Modes:**  
  Switch between "Move" and "Resize" modes via the side panel.  
  - **Move Mode:** Drag a selected box to reposition it.  
  - **Resize Mode:** Drag to change the size of a selected box while keeping its topâ€“left corner fixed.
  
- **Snap-to-Grid Optimization:**  
  Optimize your layout by snapping boxes to the nearest half-centimeter.
  
- **Save and Load Layouts:**  
  Export your layout as a JSON file and load it later.
  
- **Matplotlib Code Generation:**  
  Automatically generate Matplotlib code that recreates your design for further plotting.

## Installation

Install AxisBlueprint directly from GitHub using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/AxisBlueprint.git@main#egg=axisblueprint
```

## Usage

In a Jupyter Notebook (with Tkinter event loop enabled), run:

```python
%gui tk
from axisblueprint.main import BlueprintBuilder
BlueprintBuilder()
```

## Using the GUI

1. **Select a box:**  
Left-click on an axis box to select it. the selected box is highlighted in red and displays its numerical label.
2. **Choose Interaction Mode:**  
Use the radio buttons on the right panel to switch between **Move** and **Resize** modes: 
    - **Move:** Drag the box and reposition it
    - **Resize:** Drag to adjust the size of a box (the top left corner remains fixed)
3. **Deselect a Box:**  
Right-click anywhere on the canvas to deselect the current box.
