# AxisBlueprint

**AxisBlueprint** is a lightweight Python toolbox for interactively designing scientific figure layouts. With its easy-to-use Tkinter GUI, you can create, move, and resize axis boxes on an A4 template (with a half-centimeter grid) and then generate Matplotlib code to recreate your layout.

## Features

- **Interactive Layout Design:**  
  Create, duplicate, and remove axis boxes on a grid overlayed A4 template.
  
- **Move and Resize Modes:**  
  Switch between "Move" and "Resize" modes via the side panel.  
  - **Move Mode:** Drag a selected box to reposition it.  
  - **Resize Mode:** Drag to change the size of a selected box while keeping its top–left corner fixed.
  
- **Snap-to-Grid Optimization:**  
  Optimize your layout by snapping boxes to the nearest half-centimeter.
  
- **Save and Load Layouts:**  
  Export your layout as a JSON file and load it later.
  
- **Matplotlib Code Generation:**  
  Automatically generate Matplotlib code that recreates your design for further plotting.

## Installation
